/*Given an array of random numbers, Push all the zero’s of a given array to the end of the array. For example, if the given 
arrays is {1, 9, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 6, 0}, it should be changed to {1, 9, 8, 4, 2, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0}. The order of all other 
elements should be same. Expected time complexity is O(n) and extra space is O(1).*/
